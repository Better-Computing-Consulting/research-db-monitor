# research-db-monitor

This program monitors an Oracle database for data dumbs made by separate organization team.  

When the new data is detected in the database, the tables are converted into SAS datasets and an email is sent to the SAS programmers so they know they can continue with their part of the jobs.

The programs solves the problem of slow communitacion between the two organizations' teams, and saves time to the SAS programmers because they do not have to manually to convert the Oracle tables to SAS datasets to start their work.
